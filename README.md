California Housing EDA
Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the California Housing dataset. The goal is to understand the relationships, distributions, and patterns among key housing features, including median income, house value, population, and proximity to the ocean. Insights from this analysis can inform future predictive modeling.

Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:

longitude & latitude: Geographical location

housing_median_age: Median age of houses in the block

total_rooms, total_bedrooms: Housing structure counts

population, households: Demographic info

median_income: Median income in block

median_house_value: Target variable for housing value

ocean_proximity: Categorical feature indicating distance to the ocean

Source: California Housing dataset (from StatLib repository / sklearn.datasets
)

Key Steps

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data types

Univariate Analysis: Distribution plots, histograms, and summary statistics

Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between predictors and target

Correlation Analysis: Identifying strong relationships between features

Visualization: Boxplots, scatterplots, and pairplots for insights

Insights: Key patterns and trends summarized for future modeling

Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn


Insights

Population is higher near coastal regions

Median income shows strong correlation with median house value

Certain features are skewed and may require transformation for modeling
